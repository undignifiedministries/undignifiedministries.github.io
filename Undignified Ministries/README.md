<h1>Undignified's New Website Project</h1>
  <p>Welcome to our new website project, where we're going to build our next website from the ground up using HTML and CSS. Huge credit to Caleb, who
  actually leaned the two languages to help with this. <em>This is a public repo</em>, so please put suggestions or note down issues as you see fit.</h>
